                    property dispute, quashing of FIR brings quick relief to NRI. Quashing simply means cancelling.
                    Under criminal procedure code, a petitioner can seek quashing of First Information Report (FIR)
                    or summoning order or criminal complaint or any other order against which the alternate remedy
                    of appeal or revision does not lie. Non-Resident Indians (NRI) are more concerned with

                <p>Property Disputes have caused many a family to suffer. Hence these issues need due attention.
                    Inheritance could bring along with it the complications of illegal transfers, possession or even
                    sale by close relatives, trusted representatives and third parties.
                    Property Partition is also subject to the laws of inheritance applicable to a particular person in
                    a particular state. Different laws can apply and vary from state to state.
                    In certain urban commercial or residential properties where individual saleable units cannot be
                    carved out or partitioned, the court orders a sale of the property. After the sale, the proceeds are
                    divided according to the share of each person. Once that is done, each owner is free to take
                    whatever decision he wants to about his individual share.
                    For NRIs, it is possible to file and be suitably represented in a suit with the help of a legal
                    representative even without being actually present in India.

        <div class="criminal-litigation">
            <div class="content">
                <p>Succession Certificate is required when somebody inherits any immovable or movable
                    property under the various relevant Laws in the country. The majority of these issues are covered
                    under the Hindu Succession Act. However, the minorities are covered by their community acts or
                    the Indian Succession Act. This issue needs to be understood in the right perspective for both
                    categories.
                    For Movable Properties
                    Succession Certificate is a document which is issued by the court for claiming movable
                    properties by the successors of the deceased. It is significant, and proper advice should be sought
                    while making and implementing these.
                    For Immovable properties
                    In this case, we have situations when legal heirs stake ownership of title and possession. The title
                    of a property can be transferred through a systematic process of transfer which can be based ordone
                    through a factum of a Will or Law of Natural Succession where class I legal heirs are the
                    inheritors.</p>

                    being married in India. In this case, it will be very expensive for both parties
                    to keep coming to India for divorce proceedings.</p>
